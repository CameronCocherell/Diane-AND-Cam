            <p>My dearest Diane,</p>
<p>From the moment our paths first crossed, my life has been brighter, softer, and infinitely better because of you. Every smile, every laugh, every small moment with you is etched into my heart in a way that nothing else could ever compare.</p>
<p>I love you not just for who you are, but for how you make me feel—safe, seen, and deeply loved. I am endlessly grateful for the way you look at me, for the comfort of your hand in mine, and for the way your presence turns the ordinary into something extraordinary.</p>
<p>You are my best friend, my safe place, my greatest adventure. No matter where life takes us, please know that my heart will always be yours, in every way that matters. There’s no timeline, no distance, no obstacle that could ever change how I feel about you.</p>
<p>If I could give you the world, it still wouldn’t compare to the gift you’ve been to me. I love you endlessly, and I will spend my life cherishing the love we share.</p>
<p>Forever yours,</p>
<p>Cam</p>
